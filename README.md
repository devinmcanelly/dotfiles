# Hyprland + Helix

## TODO:
* Qt Theming
    * Some icons are still missing, waybar looks OK though.
    * Switch to semi-dark theme

* Hypr
  * Hypridle is mostly working, but hyprlock isn't there yet
  * Slurp to clipboard
    * Keybinds in general need reworking.
  * Waybar could look better
  * Mess around with wofi

* Bash / cron
  * Add scripts for:
      * Kill your darlings
      * backup ~/
      * Adv keybinds:
        * Clear workspaces & open devEnv
